|==========| Redmi Note 10 Pro / Sweet|==========|


Date : 27/07/2021
•Notes:
-Rebased device tree based on ArrowOS (Now, it's OSS)
-Users with official NusantaraProject (MIUI vendor) need to clean flash
-Don't dirty flash between vanilla and gapps version, It may cause bootloop and only method you can is format data. Don't try this!

•Bugs:
You Tell Me !!!
